# Animal Shelter API application

This is an API for a local animal shelter. The API will list the available cats and dogs at the shelter.

The entire application is contained within the `app.rb` file.

`config.ru` is a minimal Rack configuration for unicorn.

`run-tests.sh` runs a simplistic test and generates the API
documentation below.

It uses `run-curl-tests.rb` which runs each command defined in
`commands.yml`.
